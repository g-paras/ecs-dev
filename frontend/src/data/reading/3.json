'Could we get to see the menu?,' Suzzian says. 'Here you go!', the waiter says. The waiter brings water for Paula and orange juice for Suzzian. 'Have you decided your order?' the waiter asks. 'Yeah! I would like to order pasta and mashed potatoes,' Paula says. 'The same thing, but with green salad for me,' Suzzian says. 'And two portions of garlic bread too,' Paula says. 'Great. That is an amazing choice, I shall get your order super soon' the waiter says. The waiter returns after half an hour. 'Sorry to keep you waiting. Here is your order,' the waiter says. 'I asked for green salad,' Suzzian says. 'I'm sorry, I'll get those for you,' the waiter says. The waiter quickly returns with Suzzian's green salad. Both the friends have a sumptuous meal. They give an amazing tip to the waiter and leave.",
